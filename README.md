# CS499-CAPSTONE

Hello, my name is Daviel Machet and I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University. I’ve been in the Computer Science program for about four years. Since I’m active-duty military, I’ve typically taken two classes per term to balance my responsibilities. It hasn’t always been easy managing both school and service, especially during field ops and temporary assignments, but I’ve stayed consistent and committed. This journey has taught me a lot about time management, perseverance, and the value of education

While in the program I learned that this field is all about solving problems, figuring out what’s needed, breaking things down, and making sure whatever you build is functional and efficient from start to finish.

Some of the main skills I aim to show are problem solving, writing efficient and clean code, and being able to work with both front end and back-end development. I want to demonstrate that I can take a project from the planning phase all the way to deployment, using what I’ve learned about version control, testing, debugging, and integrating different technologies. My goal is to show that I can think through a problem, figure out the best way to build it, and get it done in a structured and reliable way.

These skills go hand in hand with what I want to do in my career. I’m aiming for a role where I can work on real-world applications and contribute to software development teams, especially in full stack roles. Knowing how to structure code properly, write scalable applications, and work with databases and APIs is key for that.This directly supports my focus in software engineering. I want to specialize in building reliable, user-focused applications. By improving my understanding of full stack development and the development cycle, I’m preparing myself to step into a role where I can confidently take on software projects from start to finish, whether that’s in a team setting or on my own.

This ePortfolio showcases some of the projects and assignments I’ve completed throughout the program.
